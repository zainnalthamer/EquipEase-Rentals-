# EquipEase Rentals
An Equipment Rental Management System built as part of the BICT IT8118 Advanced Programming course project. The system helps rental companies manage their inventory, process rental requests, and track rentals/returns.
It consists of two applications sharing the same database and Entity Framework Core models:
- **Rental (ASP.NET Core MVC Web App)**: Customer-facing + Staff portal.
- **FormApp (Windows Forms App)**: Admin/Manager desktop tool for day-to-day operations.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a multi-tier system where customers and staff can manage the entire rental lifecycle:
- Customers can browse equipment, request rentals, track orders, and return items.
- Staff can approve/reject requests, manage inventory, handle returns, monitor overdue rentals, and generate reports.
Both apps share a Microsoft SQL Server database and a C# Class Library (EF Core) that handles the data access layer.
